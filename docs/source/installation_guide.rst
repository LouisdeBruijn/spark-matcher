How to Install
**************

As Spark-Matcher is intended to be used with large datasets on a Spark cluster, it is assumed that Spark is already
installed. If that is not the case, first install Spark and PyArrow (:code:`pip install pyspark pyarrow`).

Install Spark-Matcher from PyPi:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install spark-matcher
